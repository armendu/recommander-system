monkeyshines one eight eight nine or one eight nine zero were a series of experimental short silent films made to test the original cylinder format of the kinetoscope are believed to be the first films shot in the united states 
monkeyshines no one was shot by william k l dickson and william heise for the edison labs scholars have differing opinions on whether the first was shot in june one eight eight nine starring john ott or sometime between november two one two seven one eight nine zero starring g sacco albanese both men were fellow lab workers at the company contradictory evidence exists for each claim monkeyshines no two and monkeyshines no three quickly followed to test further conditions 
these films were intended to be internal tests of the new camera system and were not created for commercial use their rise to prominence resulted much later due to work by film historians all three films show a blurry figure in white standing in one place making large gestures and are only a few seconds long we will never know what monkeyshines no three exactly looked like as it has disappeared from the public making it the three rd lost film that we know exists

miss jerry is an one eight nine four american feature length black and white silent pre film picture play written and produced by alexander black and starring blanche bayliss miss jerry was not a film but a series of posed magic lantern slides projected onto a screen with a dissolving stereopticon accompanied by narration and music making it the first example of a feature length dramatic fiction on screen 
miss jerry debuted on october nine one eight nine four at the carbon studio in new york city it has been described as the first picture play and while other early film and peep show animations produced at this time were short documentaries miss jerry sought to develop what is arguably the first feature of moving pictures this photoplay attempts to create an impression of movement with the slides changing once every one five seconds 
the picture play
 in miss jerry my purpose has been to test experimentally in a quiet story certain possibilities of illusion with this aim always before me that the illusion should not because it need not and could not safely be that of photographs from an acted play nor of artistic illustration but the illusion of reality 
aware of the progress made by eadweard muybridge and other photographers towards the illusion of motion black instead set out to present a convincing narrative story in front of an audience using still photography to present fiction in a convincing way rather than a perfect illusion of motion 
in his one nine two six history of the movies a million and one nights the author terry ramsaye says 
	while the motion picture was progressing with mincing steps in the peep show edison kinetoscope the sheer force of the evolution of expression presented the world with an interesting paradox the birth of the photoplay upon the screen black arrived at a rate of four slides a minute for his presentation the plan was to make the pictures successively blend into one another in the dissolving stereopticon avoiding an optical jar as much as possible each picture represented a step forward in the action the pictures were carefully registered always to present every still object in the view in precisely the same position while only the moving actors were shown in altered attitudes there could of course be no hope of depicting rapid motion black chose in such instances to picture the moments before and after the swift action involved for example the villain might stand menacing the hero with an upraised dagger while the next slide would show the victim of the stab in a heap on the floor the spoken obligation from the stage had to carry across the imagined stroke of the stabbing 
no intact set of slides for miss jerry is known to exist
